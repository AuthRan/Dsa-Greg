    "So this is an algorithm, its silly we say pointers but we really means two indices. Generally you are given an array and you put one pointer at the start and one at the end or in somecase both at the start. Now these two pointers either move towards each other or move in same direction."

    "Now becase of the name even the other case that i said about where both pointers are at start and both moves in same direction but at different speed which famously known as sliding window algorithm also becomes two pointers at the very core. BUt for simplicity when i say two pointers it usually means two pointers at the both ends and moves towards each other."
